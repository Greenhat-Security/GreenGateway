# Configuration

GreenGateway reads configuration from environment variables. Each variable is documented below with its own level-3 heading of the exact form `### VAR_NAME`. This document is kept in sync with the code by the automated drift test in `gateway/tests/env_example.rs`, so drift here is a CI failure, not just a documentation staleness risk.

### LISTEN_ADDR

The socket address the gateway binds to when it starts.

Default: `0.0.0.0:8080`

Format and validation: must parse as a Rust `SocketAddr`, such as `127.0.0.1:8080`, `0.0.0.0:8080`, or `[::1]:8080`. Non-Unicode values and invalid socket addresses are rejected during configuration loading.

### CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS

Comma-separated list of exact origins allowed by CORS.

Default: empty list. With the default, cross-origin browser requests receive no CORS allow-origin response header.

Format and validation: split on commas, trim whitespace, ignore empty entries, and require each entry to be a valid HTTP header value. Configure full origins such as `http://localhost:3000` or `https://app.example.test`.

### MAX_BODY_SIZE

Maximum request body size accepted from the `Content-Length` header, in bytes.

Default: `1048576` (1 MiB)

Format and validation: must parse as a non-negative byte count that fits in `usize`. Requests with a `Content-Length` larger than this value are rejected with `413 Payload Too Large`.

### RATE_LIMIT_READ_RPS

Read-lane token refill rate for `GET` and `HEAD` requests, in requests per second.

Default: `50.0`

Format and validation: must parse as a finite non-negative `f64`. The read lane uses a separate token bucket from mutating methods.

### RATE_LIMIT_READ_BURST

Read-lane token bucket burst size for `GET` and `HEAD` requests.

Default: `100`

Format and validation: must parse as a `u32`. A fresh read-lane bucket starts full.

### RATE_LIMIT_WRITE_RPS

Write-lane token refill rate for every method other than `GET` and `HEAD`, in requests per second.

Default: `10.0`

Format and validation: must parse as a finite non-negative `f64`. The write lane uses a separate token bucket from `GET` and `HEAD`.

### RATE_LIMIT_WRITE_BURST

Write-lane token bucket burst size for every method other than `GET` and `HEAD`.

Default: `20`

Format and validation: must parse as a `u32`. A fresh write-lane bucket starts full.

### TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS

Whether to trust `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP` as canonical client IP inputs.

Default: `false`

Format and validation: must parse as a Rust boolean, `true` or `false`. With the default, forwarded proxy headers are ignored and the connection peer IP is used. Enable this only when GreenGateway is deployed behind a trusted proxy boundary that sanitizes these headers.

### SESSION_COOKIE_NAME

Optional cookie name used for session-based rate-limit keying.

Default: empty string

Format and validation: any valid Unicode string is accepted. When empty, rate limiting falls back to the canonical client IP. When set and the request includes a matching cookie, the bucket key uses a non-cryptographic hash of that cookie value instead of the client IP.

Security note: leave this unset (the default) unless a trusted upstream/auth layer validates the session cookie before it reaches the gateway. Otherwise, because the cookie value is client-controlled and not yet validated, a client can rotate it to evade rate limiting. Key on the canonical client IP, which is the default behavior when unset, until sessions are validated.

### VALIDATION_ALLOWED_CONTENT_TYPES

Comma-separated list of `Content-Type` prefixes accepted for mutating requests.

Default: `application/json`

Format and validation: split on commas, trim whitespace, ignore empty entries, and require each entry to be a valid HTTP header value. `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests are accepted when their `Content-Type` starts with any configured entry, allowing values such as `application/json; charset=utf-8`.
