# Configuration

GreenGateway reads configuration from environment variables. Each variable is documented below with its own level-3 heading of the exact form `### VAR_NAME`. This document is kept in sync with the code by the automated drift test in `gateway/tests/env_example.rs`, so drift here is a CI failure, not just a documentation staleness risk.

### LISTEN_ADDR

The socket address the gateway binds to when it starts.

Default: `0.0.0.0:8080`

Format and validation: must parse as a Rust `SocketAddr`, such as `127.0.0.1:8080`, `0.0.0.0:8080`, or `[::1]:8080`. Non-Unicode values and invalid socket addresses are rejected during configuration loading.
